Python Script Examples
======================

You can find various XOA Python scripts in our public GitHub repository `Xena OpenAutomation Script Example Library <https://github.com/xenanetworks/tld-xoa-python-script-library>`_. It includes script examples of how you can use XOA Driver to configure a Xena tester.

What Example Folder Contains
----------------------------

Each folder contains at least three files:

* Python script file - this is where the example code locates
* requirements.txt - dependencies to run the code. You should `pip install -r requirements.txt` to update your Python environment (either global or virtual) to have the necessary dependencies.
