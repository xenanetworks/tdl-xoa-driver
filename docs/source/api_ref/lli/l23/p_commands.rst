Port
=================================

This module contains the **L23 port classes** that deal with basic information about, and configuration of L23 test ports. The L23 port command names all have the form ``P_<xxx>`` and require a module index id and a port index id. In general, port commands cannot be changed while traffic is on. Additionally, every stream must be disabled before changing parameters that affect the bandwidth of the port.
