Filter
=================================

This module contains the **L23 port filter classes** that deal with configuration of the filters on the received traffic of a port.

The filter command names all have the form ``PF_<xxx>``, and require both a module index id and a port index id, as well as a sub-index identifying a particular filter.

Each filter specifies a compound Boolean condition on these true/false values to determine if the filter as a whole is true/false.

While a filter is enabled, neither its condition nor the definition of each match term or length term used by the condition can be changed.
