Duplication Scheduling
=========================

Schedule
--------------------------
Configure the impairment scheduler function.  The configuration of the scheduler
depends on the kind of distribution to schedule:

1. Burst distributions: "Fixed Burst" and "Accumulate and Burst".
2. Non-Burst distributions: All others.  For burst distributions, the scheduler can be configured for "One-shot" operation or "Repeat Operation".  When running in "Repeat Operation" the "Repeat Period" must be configured. For non-burst distributions,  the scheduler can be configured operate in either "Continuous" or "Repeat Period" modes. When running in "Repeat Period" configuration of "Duration" and "Repeat Period" is required.

Corresponding low-level API class: :class:`~xoa_driver.internals.commands.ped_commands.PED_SCHEDULE`

.. code-block:: python

    flow = port.emulation.flows[1] # e.g. flow_id = 1
    await flow.impairment_distribution.duplication_type_config.schedule.set(duration=1, period=1) # repeat pattern
    await flow.impairment_distribution.duplication_type_config.schedule.set(duration=0, period=0) # continuous

    resp = await flow.impairment_distribution.duplication_type_config.schedule.get()


One-Shot Status
--------------------------
Retrieves the one-shot completion status.

.. note::

    The return value is only valid, if the configured distribution is either accumulate & burst (DELAY) or fixed burst (non-DELAY).

Corresponding low-level API class: :class:`~xoa_driver.internals.commands.ped_commands.PED_ONESHOTSTATUS`

.. code-block:: python

    flow = port.emulation.flows[1] # e.g. flow_id = 1
    resp = await flow.impairment_distribution.duplication_type_config.one_shot_status.get()
    resp.one_shot_status
