Match Term
=================================

This module contains the **L23 port match term classes** that deal with configuration of the length term on the received traffic of a port.

The match term command names all have the form ``PM_<xxx>``, and require both a module index id and a port index id, as well as a sub-index identifying a particular match term.

The match terms provide basic true/false indications for each packet received on the port.

While a filter is enabled, neither its condition nor the definition of each match term or length term used by the condition can be changed.
