Capture
=================================

This module contains the **L23 port capture classes** that deal with configuration of the capture criteria and inspection of the captured data from a port.

Whether the port is enabled for capturing packets is specified by the ``P_CAPTURE`` command. Captured packets are indexed starting from 0, and are stored in a buffer that is cleared before capture starts. While on, the capture configuration parameters cannot be changed.

The capture command names all have the form ``PC_<xxx>`` and require both a module index id and a port index id. The per-packet parameters also use a sub-index identifying a particular packet in the capture buffer.
