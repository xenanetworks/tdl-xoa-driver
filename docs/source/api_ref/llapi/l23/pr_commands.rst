RX Statistics
=================================

This module contains the **L23 port RX statistics classes** that provide quantitative information about the received packets on a port.

The command names all have the form ``PR_<xxx>`` and require both a module index id and a port index id. Those commands dealing with a specific received test payload id and a specific filter also have a sub-index id.

All bit-and byte-level statistics are at layer-2, so they include the full Ethernet frame, and exclude the inter-frame gap and preamble.
