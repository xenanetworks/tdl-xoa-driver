Chassis
=================================

This module contains the **chassis classes** that deal with basic information and configuration of the chassis itself (rather than its modules and test ports), as well as overall control of the scripting session. The chassis command names all have the form ``C_<xxx>`` and use neither a module index nor a port index.
